I was looking for a simple program to quickly compile files with .vcf extension (Compatible with Android - Windows - Gmail - etc.).
I found on the net (I don't remember where, but redo here on github) a simple script in dos of a certain BL4CKH47H4CK3R (unfortunately I can no longer find the source ...), the basic idea was very good, but the script had some bugs, especially some loops that were infinite ...

However, a small adjustment to the if else conditions was enough to make the program fully functional, I also added a function that I needed a lot in everyday working life, that is the "merge contacts" function that allows you to merge multiple vcf files in one file.

<b>CAUTION!</b>

<b>NEVER INSERT ORIGINAL .VCF FILES INTO THE ROOT OF THE PROGRAM, BECAUSE SOME FUNCTIONS DELETE THE .VCF FILES PRESENT IN THE FOLDER BEFORE PERFORMING ITS OPERATIONS (YOU WILL ALWAYS BE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE PROMPT OF THE COMMANDS), ALWAYS INSERT A COPY OF YOUR FILES ORIGINAL! AND ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR .VC FILES IN A SAFE LOCATION ON YOUR PC BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM!!!</b>

P.S. I could have put a backup function in a specific folder, but I didn't have the time or the inclination...</BR>
I just needed a simple program to write and use, and that's it... </BR>
Cheers
